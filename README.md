# Real-Time Face Verification & Attendance System (Python + OpenCV + Face Recognition)

This project is a real-time face verification and attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and the Face Recognition library (dlib).  
It automatically detects and verifies employee faces through a webcam feed and records attendance in a CSV file — ensuring each employee’s attendance is marked only once per day.

# How It Works

   - File names represent employee names (e.g. `abc.jpg`, `xyz.png`).  
2. Run the script:  python main.py
